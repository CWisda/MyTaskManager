# MyTaskManager

This task manager was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and JQuery

## In the Task Manager you can create a new task with specific fields and once the task appears in the second half of the page you can complete and detele your tasks. 

## TODO 
With time I would like to add a few nice to have features: 
- Create a user authentication page so it can be more private and customized
- Allow the user to send a task to a friend via email or SMS
- Create a mobile version of this application
